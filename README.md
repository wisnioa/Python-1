# Inventory Management System

## Description

This is a simple command-line inventory management program written in Python. It allows the user to add, update, remove, view, and search for items in an inventory.

This project was created as the final project for a Python 1 class.

---

## Features

- Add items to the inventory  
- Update existing items  
- Remove items  
- View all items  
- Search for items by category  
- Exit the program  

---

## How It Works

- The program stores items in a list called `inventory`.
- Each item is saved as a dictionary with:
  - name
  - price
  - quantity
  - category
- The program runs in a loop and displays a menu until the user chooses to exit.

---

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Save the file.
3. Open a terminal in the file’s directory.
4. Run:

```
python filename.py
```

## Notes

- The inventory is not saved after the program closes.
- Entering non-numeric values for price or quantity will cause an error.
